Analysis of the Effectiveness of Three Different Sales Methods to Sell New Products

The goal of this analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of targeted calls, emails, and a combination of the two (email & call) sales strategies prior to the launch of a new product line for Pens and Printers. First-party data was collected by the business over a 6-week period with the goal of achieving the highest gross revenue. Therefore, the target metric chosen was the revenue generated by the new products sold, as this variable was dependent on the other features from the provided dataset.
